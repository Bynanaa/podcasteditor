<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Over the past four years, I’ve worked on podcasts of varying complexity. These have ranged from simple solo podcasts recorded on an iPhone, to reality shows with up to ten voices. I approach each new task with enthusiasm and dedication, regardless of its complexity or cost.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Editing fees usually start at $60 for the first half hour of two-track recording. For commercial projects and episodes that require sound design, the price may increase.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m always open to informal communication: feel free to write and get to know me, even if your podcast is still in the planning stages. I will be happy to help you find a studio to record your voice, or prepare you for home recording so that your voice does not have to be restored.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Examples of audio before and after editing are available upon request. I can also edit a small section of your recording for free.</p>
  </li>
